Good evening everyone, I am glad to announce [CosmicResources](https://cosmicresources.org). It is a repository for Physics A level notes (specifically for CAIE board), along with topical mcq questions and a Youtube channel for solving past paper questions. In the future I would like to expand the notes with my version of the lecture notes from the college I end up attending.
If you want to contribute you can open a pull request on the site's [Github Page](https://github.com/XdRoastedShoes/CosmicResources) with the improvements/notes which you would like to submit.
